# Revature Swag Shop: Front End

The Revature Swag shop is an employee accessible merchandise store that was built from scratch and uses a microservice architecture. As a revature employee, you can login to the shop and view your RevCoins (the shop currency) history. An employee can exchange these RevCoins for the various goods the shop offers.

With the Swag Shop, users can log in and add items to their cart they wish to purchase. If the user has enough RevCoins for the purchase they can proceed to checkout and process the order for the items they selected. An admin user can login to the shop and update the items we have in stock, as well as add additional items to the stock.
