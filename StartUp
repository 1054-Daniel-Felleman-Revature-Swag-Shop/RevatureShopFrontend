To run the current version of the front end of the Revature Swag Shop
We collectively were using VScode as an IDE
through the terminal we used the command npm install to allow us
to utilize Angular

Create a folder on your local machine to hold the front and backend projects.
then you can git bash into those respective folders and pull from git hub for the front end
and short of any refactoring for depricated code after doing so
run the ng serve command in the terminal

The web application will then default to localhost:4200.
